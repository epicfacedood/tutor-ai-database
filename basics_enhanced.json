    "Vertical_Line_Test": {
      "definition": "A method to determine if a relation is a function by checking that each x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value.",
      "explanation": "If any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, the relation is not a function. This helps identify functions from non-functions and understand common misconceptions like piecewise definitions."
    },
    "Inverse_Functions": {
      "definition": "A function that reverses another function, denoted as f\u207b\u00b9(x), such that applying f followed by f\u207b\u00b9 (or vice versa) returns the original input.",
      "existence": "Only exists if the function is one-to-one (injective); a horizontal line test can determine this.",
      "examples_and_explanations": "Functions like linear equations with slope \u2260 0 have inverses. Piecewise functions without domain restrictions typically do not have inverses."
    },
    "Composite_Functions": {
      "definition": "A function formed by using the output of one function as the input of another, denoted as gf(x) = g(f(x)).",
      "range_finding": "Involves finding the range after substituting step-by-step and considering domain restrictions for accurate results."

    "Inverse_Functions": "Misunderstanding that non-one-to-one functions have inverses. Emphasize the need for domain restrictions to make them one-to-one."
