# Document Organizer - Implementation Summary

## What We've Created

We've developed a Python script that organizes educational PDF documents by:

1. **Matching question papers with their solutions** based on filename similarity
2. **Classifying standalone documents** into multiple categories based on filename analysis:
   - Standalone notes
   - Standalone questions
   - Standalone solutions
   - Notes with questions
   - Notes with solutions
   - Combined question-solution documents

## Key Features

- **Filename-based matching**: Identifies question-solution pairs by analyzing filename similarities and keywords
- **Advanced filename classification**: Analyzes document filenames to determine their specific type and content
- **Pattern recognition**: Uses common educational document naming patterns to improve classification accuracy
- **Organized output structure**: Creates a clean directory structure with paired and standalone documents properly categorized

## How to Use

1. Place PDF files in the `dataprocessing/raw_data/notes` directory
2. Run `python organize_documents.py`
3. Find organized files in the `organized_data` directory

## Technical Implementation

The script uses several techniques:

- **Keyword detection and combination analysis** in filenames
- **Text similarity algorithms** to match related documents
- **Regular expressions** for pattern matching and text normalization
- **Multi-category classification** based on document content indicators

## Next Steps

To enhance this solution:

1. **Add more document types**: Expand to handle more educational document categories
2. **Improve classification accuracy**: Refine the keyword lists and pattern recognition
3. **Add metadata extraction**: Extract and store information about each document
4. **Implement a GUI**: Create a user interface for easier document management
5. **Add content-based fallback**: Use content analysis as a fallback for documents that can't be classified by filename
